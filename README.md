# iOS-Weather-App
An iOS weather app "look alike" I developed with Xcode that allows the user to switch between two 
screens and gives the user the ability to search and find the current weather conditions of any city in the world. 
This app uses cocopods like JSON, and Alamofire. All weather data was gathered from OpenWeatherMap's databases. I 
followed video tutorials from the London app brewery through Udemy to create this.
