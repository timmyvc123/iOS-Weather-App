# iOS-Weather-App
An iOS weather app "look alike" I developed with Xcode that allows the user to switch between two 
screens and gives the user the ability to search and find the current weather conditions of any city in the world. Uses weather data gathered from OpenWeatherMap's databases networking, APIs, control structures, cloud data, CocoaPods, and Alamofire and JSON format for server communications. I followed video tutorials from the London app brewery through Udemy to create this.
